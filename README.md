## **Introduction**
Customer churn is a critical issue for banks, directly impacting profitability and growth. The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts churn based on customer behavior and demographics, helping banks to proactively address churn risks.

---

## **Features**
1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Categorical encoding for non-numerical data.  
   - Missing data handling and outlier detection.  
   - Feature scaling for uniformity in model inputs.  

2. **Imbalanced Dataset Handling**:  
   - Techniques like **SMOTE** were used to balance the dataset.  

3. **Model Development**:  
   - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier for predictions.  
   - Hyperparameter tuning using **Grid Search**.  

4. **Evaluation Metrics**:  
   - **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-Score**, and **ROC-AUC**.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `Pandas` and `NumPy` for data preprocessing  
  - `Scikit-learn` for machine learning models  
  - `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for data visualization  

---

## **Dataset**
The dataset used in this project contains customer data such as:  
- Customer demographics (e.g., age, gender).  
- Account information (e.g., balance, tenure).  
- Transactional details and other behavioral patterns.  

(Note: Add dataset link or mention if itâ€™s proprietary or synthetic.)
